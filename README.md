#Part 1.

##Digital thick coating board painting is an imaging technique that I really like. I hope to incorporate elements such as colors, lines, sets, and large areas of color blocks from the examples into my project. This artistic style is very suitable for display through coding because it includes a lot of hard lines. These lines are simple, yet sufficient to outline the contours of figures. At the same time, the colors of the paintings are very visually impactful, suitable for creating images with color blocks generated by different codes. This abstract artistic style is also very suitable to be paired with coding, as they both belong to digital art.

#Part 2.

##Using JavaScript to manipulate SVG to obtain clear lines and geometric shapes, and fill in corresponding colors. Combined with the HTML5 Canvas API, it is possible to achieve brush-like texture effects. This coding technique can make complex paintings a reality through coding.
